# (headless) CMS search

- **ROBUST AND BEAUTIFUL CMS DASHBOARD** => MULTIUSER SUPPORT, MULTILANG, EDIT HISTORY
- **MAINTAINABLE FOR SMALL TEAMS** => FULL STACK SIMPLICITY
- **MODERN JS** => Best case: Svelte(Kit)
- **Active community & learning resources** 
- Open Source, GraphQL support(?), a11y, sustainable, etc.

=> twill => ... currently exploring it, connect to sveltekit via twill-api / experimental graphql (via lighthouse)?

=> WordPress => built-in pages, great dashboard experience? Wait for Atlas Content Modeler to support multi-user/custom post types? (Building it custom would be over head?), but: bloated, needs a lot of customization ...


=> Strapi has advantage in Content Builder Settings via dashboard, is there a similiar PHP solution? https://strapi.io/ But: pricy to host.

=> Directus?


=> Cockpit? => but needs mongodb?

Butter/Statamic -> not open source ... 
https://buttercms.com/ 

=> https://www.storyblok.com/ - starts at 90â‚¬/month

=> https://www.netlify.com/pricing/ => starts at $19 .. server region EU possible?

=> Laravel Livewire => no dashboard with multi user support?!

=> https://statamic.com/pricing, gets graphql support (https://statamic.dev/graphql), podcast:

- SAAS approaches like https://www.sanity.io/, https://graphcms.com/,  ?

There will be some Svelte Things coming up?!
