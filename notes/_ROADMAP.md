# _ROADMAP

Projects and stacks, which I want to explore.

I want to use mainly Svelte for interactive experience, but also want to use static site generation (SSG) as much as possible in regards to Sustainable Web Design.


## April / May / June / July 2022

- A) Normal bootstrap5 site with Kirby ([bahn-zum-see](https://github.com/mandrasch/bahn-zum-see))
  - try out -> https://github.com/getkirby/staticache
  - try out deployment (composer -> manitu hosting)

- B) PWA Web-App, content editable via backend (bahn-zum-see?)
  - Kirby (+ KQL) + ...
    - SvelteKit?
    - Astro?

- Optional: Full static site, content editable via backend
  - Astro + Svelte + Kirby (+ KQL)?
  - 11ty + Kirby (+ KQL)?
  - SvelteKit + Kirby (+ KQL)?
  - Headless WordPress?

- C) Multi-User-App (Greenrunners)
  - Svelte Kit + ...
    - Laravel Sanctum?
    - Supabase/Firebase?
  - Inertia + Vue (SSR)?
  - Or https://laravel-livewire.com/?


  PWA => https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-pwa


<hr>

**Old 2**
- A) Svelte/Inertia/Laravel
  - 1. build demo app greenrunners
  - 2. Learn more about laravel (migrations, auth, etc.)
  - 3. Finish laracasts course "Inertia and SPA Techniques" 
- B) WordPress + bootscore, Gutenberg theme or something different, what's the nicest way for small flexible projects
  - + ACF(, pods, carbon fields, etc.?)
- C) + static site generator / headless option for WP?
