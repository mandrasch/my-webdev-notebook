1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwjX8JAwBws&t=2457s complete tutorial
1. Connect SvelteKit + https://getkirby.com/plugins/getkirby/kql 

TODO: check out astro, has built-in support for svelte and aims for static sites?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsTXcSeAZq8

Both SvelteKit and Astro are frameworks for building websites. SvelteKit does best with highly dynamic websites (like dashboards and inboxes) while Astro does best with highly static websites (like content and eCommerce websites).

https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/src/pages/en/comparing-astro-vs-other-tools.md#sveltekit-vs-astro

=> Astro for static sites
=> SvelteKit for highly dynamic apps ...

Is 11ty easier for oldschool pages with kql?
https://davedavies.dev/post/how-to-use-11ty-with-headless-wordpress/

But then we can't use svelte to spice things up?

What about search? We need to connect to the server anyway? So we could sveltekit ssr maybe as well?!
