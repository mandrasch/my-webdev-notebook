# _2DO-NEXT

=> TWO MONTHS LEFT => FINISH WITH MULTI SITE APPS AND NUXT/VUE! :-)

1. Realtime APP => https://codecourse.com/courses/create-a-realtime-post-timeline-with-nuxt-and-laravel

--> **REQUIRES:** JWT nuxt/auth instead of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIzPuM76-nI or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6aEtzcGSk&t=937s

=> Repo: https://github.com/mandrasch/codecourse-laravel-nuxt-realtime (Nuxt2)

2. Nuxt3
https://v3.nuxtjs.org/
https://github.com/epicmaxco/vuestic-ui 

https://codecourse.com/watch/getting-started-with-nuxt-3

REPO: nuxt3-test

https://blog.thepatik.com/top-5-nuxtjs-modules-for-your-next-project-2022-edition

3. Optional: Laravel Graphl + nuxt -> https://codecourse.com/courses/build-a-job-board-with-laravel-graphql-nuxt-and-apoll

(Other ways to go would be Angular or react ...)

GOAL: Full multi user app with nuxt <-> laravel

<hr>

Thoughts about SSR vs. CSR:

- Nuxt can be deployed as SPA if there is no project budget for SSR hosting
- CSR is fine for highly interactive apps without SEO https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1528888382289494023

<hr>

Bonus: Tailwind crash course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ

  => erstmal einfach Bootstrap Styles nutzen...

- Kirby KQL (-> agency context)

- Astro => Bootstrap5 => include JS via normal asset (node_modules => dist => copy it ... )

Watch till end:

- Kirby - Sebastian, how to get nice panels for editors? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwjX8JAwBws&t=2457s

- https://github.com/svelteness/kit-docs => for this repo

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwjX8JAwBws&t=2457s complete tutorial
1. Connect SvelteKit + https://getkirby.com/plugins/getkirby/kql 

TODO: check out astro, has built-in support for svelte and aims for static sites?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsTXcSeAZq8

Both SvelteKit and Astro are frameworks for building websites. SvelteKit does best with highly dynamic websites (like dashboards and inboxes) while Astro does best with highly static websites (like content and eCommerce websites).

https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/src/pages/en/comparing-astro-vs-other-tools.md#sveltekit-vs-astro

=> Astro for static sites
=> SvelteKit for highly dynamic apps ... 

<hr>

Is 11ty easier for oldschool pages with kql?
https://davedavies.dev/post/how-to-use-11ty-with-headless-wordpress/

But then we can't use svelte to spice things up?

What about search? We need to connect to the server anyway? So we could sveltekit ssr maybe as well?!
